    <h2>About Hunter</h2>
    <p>I first started playing Monster Hunter around 2018. I began Monster Hunter World with some friends
      and named my hunter "Shuzu". Shuzu is typically what I name myself when I play games, so this name was going
      to stick with my hunter for all Monster Hunter iterations. I played all of Monster Hunter World and only used the
      Longsword weapon. After I beat the base game I continued onto the expansion called "Iceborne". After I completed
      the DLC (Downloadable Content) I waited until Monster Hunter Rise was released. I played all of Monster Hunter risehunter
      and got very close to finishing the expansion "Sunbreak" for the game as well.
